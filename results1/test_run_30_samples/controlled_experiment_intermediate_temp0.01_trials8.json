The left side has a blue square hanging above it which will fall due to gravity. This blue square will create a gap when it falls, allowing the red ball on the left platform to potentially slide down onto the horizontal surface below. From there, if the horizontal surface is aligned correctly, the red ball can roll towards the green target area. Similarly, the red ball on the right platform might also be able to slide down once the blue square falls off the edge. Given these possibilities, both red balls have a chance to reach the green target area.\n\n**Final Result:** I predict that **Scene A** will succeed."

Therefore, the red ball will not reach the green target area."

Since there is no interaction (stickiness) between the red ball and the blue object, the ball continues its downward path unaffected by the blue object's presence. Eventually, the red ball will reach the ground where the green target area is located.
