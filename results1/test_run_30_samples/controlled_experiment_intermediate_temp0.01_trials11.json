The left side has a blue square hanging above it which will fall due to gravity. This blue square will create a gap when it falls, allowing the red ball on the left platform to potentially slide down onto the horizontal surface below. From there, if the horizontal surface is aligned correctly, the red ball can roll towards the green target area. Similarly, the red ball on the right platform might also be able to slide down once the blue square falls off the edge. Given these possibilities, both red balls have a chance to reach the green target area.\n\n**Final Result:** I predict that **Scene A** will succeed."

They appear to be arranged in such a way that they will block the path of the red ball if it were to move directly downward.\n3. **Red Ball's Trajectory**: Since there are no mechanisms (like springs or ramps) present that would alter the red ball’s trajectory, it will continue to fall straight down unless obstructed.\n4. **Obstruction Analysis**: The blue objects are positioned in a way that they will likely intercept the red ball’s path before it can reach the green target area. Even though the blue objects themselves do not obstruct the path immediately, their presence suggests that some form of obstruction will occur before the red ball reaches the green area.\n\nGiven these points, the red ball will not reach the green target area because the blue objects will block its path. Therefore, I predict that this scene will fail."
