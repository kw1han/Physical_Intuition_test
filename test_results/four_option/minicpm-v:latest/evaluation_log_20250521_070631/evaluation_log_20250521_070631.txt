To determine which scene will allow the red ball to successfully reach the green target area, we need to analyze the initial positions and possible movements of all objects.

In Scene A:
- The blue object is on top but not within reach.
- The red ball is near a cliff with no path to move down or around it easily.

In Scene B:
- Similar to Scene A in terms of obstacles; however, there might be an opening below the black surface that could allow movement downwards. 

In Scene C:
- There's only one obstacle which seems manageable.
- The red ball is near a cliff but has more options for potential paths compared to other scenes.

In Scene D:
- Similar setup as in Scene A and B with blue object on top, however here it appears slightly closer than before making the path less obvious.

Considering these points:

1. **Scene C** offers an easier pathway due to fewer obstacles (just one) which makes moving down or around more feasible.
2. Compared to other scenes where objects are placed in such a way that they could obstruct movement, Scene A and D look most promising but still have potential issues with the blue object on top.

Therefore, **Scene C** is likely the best scenario for allowing the red ball to successfully reach the green target area based on physical principles.

Upon analyzing both scenes, we observe that Scene A is identical to Scene B except the red ball's initial position and orientation are reversed.

Now let us focus on Scenes C and D:
In Scene C, the red ball starts at a higher elevation compared to its counterpart in Scene D. Given gravity plays no role here as it seems like an indoor scenario without any significant slope or free-fall conditions for the balls' movement, we can deduce that neither gravitational force nor initial speed is affecting their movements.

However, there are noticeable differences between these two scenes:
- In Scene C, a blue pentagon blocks part of the green target area.
- In Scene D, no such obstruction exists near or within reach of the red ball's starting position and orientation relative to the green target. 

With this information in mind, we can infer that due to an unimpeded path directly from its initial point (relative to gravity), Scene D presents a more straightforward route for the red ball to navigate towards the green target area without any physical obstacles obstructing its way.

Therefore, based on the analysis of object positions and orientations with respect to obstacle distributions in each scene:
Scene D is most likely to allow the red ball to successfully reach the green target area.
