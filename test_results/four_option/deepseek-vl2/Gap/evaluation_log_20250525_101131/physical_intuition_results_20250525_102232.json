The blue rectangle is also in the same position as in Scene A. The red ball will fall and likely bounce off the blue triangle, which is positioned to the right of the ball. The ball's trajectory will curve, and it will roll towards the green target area. The blue rectangle may slightly influence the ball's path, but it should still reach the green region.\n\nScene C: The red ball is positioned near the top left corner, with the blue triangle positioned directly above it and the blue rectangle below it. The green target area is at the bottom right. The red ball will fall and bounce off the blue triangle. The ball's trajectory will curve, and it will roll towards the green target area. The blue rectangle is positioned below the red ball, so it will not significantly affect the ball's path. The ball should reach the green region.\n\nScene D: The red ball is positioned near the top left corner, with the blue triangle positioned directly above it and the blue rectangle below it. The green target area is at the bottom right. The red ball will fall and bounce off the blue triangle. The ball's trajectory will curve, and it will roll towards the green target area.
