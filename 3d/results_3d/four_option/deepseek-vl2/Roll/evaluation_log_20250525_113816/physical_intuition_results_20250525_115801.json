The green object will move toward the red object due to the attraction between them. The red object is not moving toward the green object, but it is positioned near the yellow region.

Therefore, the red object will fall due to gravity and will make contact with the yellow region.\n\nReasoning: The red object is positioned above the yellow region and there is no green object to affect its trajectory.
