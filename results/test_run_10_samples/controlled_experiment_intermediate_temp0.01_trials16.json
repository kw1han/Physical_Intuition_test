As it falls, it creates a downward force on the black platform because of Newton's third law (for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction).\n\n3. **Platform's Movement**: Due to the falling blue object, the black platform experiences a downward acceleration caused by the gravitational pull of the blue object. This downward acceleration causes the black platform to tilt slightly downwards towards the right side.\n\n4. **Red Ball's Trajectory**: Since the black platform tilts, the red ball, which is initially on top of the platform, begins to roll off due to the change in slope. It rolls down the tilted surface of the platform.\n\n5. **Target Area's Distance**: The green target area is positioned further away horizontally than the distance the red ball can travel while rolling off the tilted platform. Given the angle of tilt and the speed at which the red ball would roll off, it does not have enough horizontal velocity to reach the green target area.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, despite the red ball rolling off the platform, it lacks sufficient horizontal velocity to overcome the distance to the green target area.
