    "response": "Yes.\n\nThe three balls start at different heights and move downwards due to gravity. The first two balls have no obstacles below them so they continue moving until reaching their respective targets (the black columns). \n\nHowever, there is an obstacle for the third ball - it cannot pass through the blue triangle which lies directly above its path towards the rightmost column. Therefore, this ball does not fall into any of the columns but instead bounces off the top edge of the screen when it hits the blue triangle. This means that none of these balls can actually hit or enter the green target area as intended by the game rules. So my final conclusion would be \"No\"."
