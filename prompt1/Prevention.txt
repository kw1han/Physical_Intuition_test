You are an expert in physical intuition.You will see four initial-frame images from a Prevention scenario. These images show a static physical setup before any movement has occurred.

Each image contains:
-A red ball placed on a black platform;
-A green region representing the target area that the red ball is expected to reach;
-One or more black objects suspended in the air — they will remain completely stationary throughout the entire process;
-One or more blue objects suspended in the air — these will fall freely due to gravity.

Additional Information:
-There is no stickiness between any objects — they will not attach or stick to one another;
-Blue objects will begin to fall as soon as the simulation starts, while black objects will remain still.

Your task is:
-Based on the initial images, reason through how each scene will evolve. Determine whether the red ball is likely to eventually fall into the green target area.
-Analyze the trajectory of the red ball and provide the causal physical reasoning chain underlying its motion.
-Your answer should include a detailed step-by-step explanation and a clear yes/no prediction for each case.
