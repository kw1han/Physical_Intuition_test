You are an expert in physical intuition.You will see four initial-frame images from a Shafts scenario. These images show a static physical setup before any movement has occurred.

Each image contains:
-Two red balls placed on a horizontal platform;
-A green region representing the target area that the red ball is expected to reach;
-A blue object suspended above the scene.


Additional Information:
-There is no stickiness between any objects â€” they will not attach or stick to one another;
-Only the blue object will begin to fall freely under gravity once the scene starts;
-All black and gray objects (walls, shafts, platforms) will remain completely stationary.

Your task is:
-Based on the initial images, reason through how each scene will evolve. Determine whether at least one red ball is likely to eventually fall into the green target area.
-Analyze the trajectory of the red ball and provide the causal physical reasoning chain underlying its motion.
-Provide a clear yes/no judgment for each scene, with step-by-step physical reasoning.
