You are an expert in physical intuition.You will see four initial-frame images from a Bridge scenario. These images show a static physical setup before any movement has occurred.

Each image contains:
-A red ball suspended in the air, which will fall due to gravity;
-A green region representing the target area that the red ball is expected to reach;
-A blue horizontal structure made up of two thinner segments, suspended above a gap.

Additional Information:
-The blue horizontal plank is composed of two short blue segments;
-These two segments are not rigidly connected, and may separate or collapse during the process;
-There is no stickiness between any objects â€” they will not attach to each other;
-Any object that is suspended in the air at the beginning will fall freely due to gravity.

Your task is:
-Based on the initial images, reason through how each scene will evolve. Determine whether the red ball is likely to eventually fall into the green target area.
-Analyze the trajectory of the red ball and provide the causal physical reasoning chain underlying its motion.
-Provide a clear yes/no judgment for each scene, with step-by-step physical reasoning.
