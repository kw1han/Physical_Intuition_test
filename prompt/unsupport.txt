You are an expert in physical intuition.You will see four initial-frame images from an Unsupport scenario. These images show a static physical setup before any movement has occurred.

Each image contains:
-Three red balls placed at different positions;
-A green region representing the target area that the red ball is expected to reach;
-Several thin blue objects forming vertical and horizontal structures.

Additional Information:
-The vertical blue bars are composed of multiple smaller blue segments stacked together;
-These segments are not tightly connected, and may detach or collapse when their support is removed;
-There is no stickiness between any objects — they will not attach to each other;
-Any object that is suspended in the air at the beginning will fall freely due to gravity.

Your task is:
-Based on the initial images, reason through how each scene will evolve. Determine whether any of the red balls are likely to eventually fall into the green target area.
-Analyze the trajectory of the red ball and provide the causal physical reasoning chain underlying its motion.
-Your answer should include a detailed step-by-step explanation and a clear yes/no prediction for each case.

Please analyze all four scenes in order, and answer:
Which initial scene is most likely to result in at least one red ball falling into the green target area?

This is a single-choice task: You must select exactly one option — the one you believe has the highest likelihood of success.

Scenes are labeled A, B, C, and D. The order is random.
Please make your decision solely based on physical reasoning and visual content, without relying on sequence or position.

Please structure your answer as follows:
Reasoning: For each scene, explain step by step what will happen, whether the red ball will fall into the green region, and why you believe scene X has the highest chance of success.
Final Result: “I predict that scene X will succeed.”
