You are an expert in physical intuition.You will see four initial-frame images from a Shafts scenario. These images show a static physical setup before any movement has occurred.

Each image contains:
-Two red balls placed on a horizontal platform;
-A green region representing the target area that the red ball is expected to reach;
-A blue object suspended above the scene.


Additional Information:
-There is no stickiness between any objects — they will not attach or stick to one another;
-Only the blue object will begin to fall freely under gravity once the scene starts;
-All black and gray objects (walls, shafts, platforms) will remain completely stationary.

Your task is:
-Based on the initial images, reason through how each scene will evolve. Determine whether at least one red ball is likely to eventually fall into the green target area.
-Analyze the trajectory of the red ball and provide the causal physical reasoning chain underlying its motion.
-Provide a clear yes/no judgment for each scene, with step-by-step physical reasoning.

Please analyze all four scenes in order, and answer:
Which initial scene is most likely to result in at least one red ball falling into the green target area?

This is a single-choice task: You must select exactly one option — the one you believe has the highest likelihood of success.

Scenes are labeled A, B, C, and D. The order is random.
Please make your decision solely based on physical reasoning and visual content, without relying on sequence or position.

Please structure your answer as follows:
Reasoning: For each scene, explain step by step what will happen, whether the red ball will fall into the green region, and why you believe scene X has the highest chance of success.
Final Result: “I predict that scene X will succeed.”
